downloading Java SDK
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04

to compile it 
javac [source file].java

to execute
java [main class]

basically what happens is
	classes are in a .java file
	when complied they make all the classes inside .java 
	the classes are complied and executables are .class
	run each class as needed

also can use as main
public static void main(String[] args)  
public static void main(String []args)  
public static void main(String args[])  
public static void main(String... args)  
static public void main(String[] args)  
public static final void main(String[] args)  
final public static void main(String[] args)  
final strictfp public static void main(String[] args) 

JVM 
	Java Virtual Machine
	abstract  machine - specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecod
	e can be executed
	
	
JRE
	
	Java Runtime Environment
	used to provide runtime enviorment and is helped with libraries

JDK
	Java Development Kit
	Contains JRE and development tools

JVM inside JRE inside JDK

Java Variables
	local variable
	variable which is declared inside the method

	instance variable
	variable which is declared inside the class but outside the method, is called instance 
	variable

	static variable
	a variable that has a universal scope which cannot be local

Java Data Types
	

	Primitive
		boolean    false    1 bit
	Numeric
		char       '\u0000' 2 byte	
	Integral
		Integer
			byte     0      1 byte
			short    0      2 byte
			int      0      4 byte
			long     0L     8 byte
		Floating-Point
			float    0.0f   4 byte
			double   0.0d   8 byte
	Non-Primitive   

	--when a Floating-point number has a fraction value, you must use f like 10.5f to 
	indicate to the complier that it is such a number
	-- when adding byte numbers do 
	byte a=10;  
	byte b=10; 	
	byte c=(byte)(a+b);

Unicode 
	universal but not completely compatbilite some characters use different bytes
